# MD-collapse-sections

A cheap-and-cheerful way to turn markdown documents into HTML documents with collapsable section headers. I didn't find a satisfactory solution elsewhere so I coded this up in Python. It works under Python 3 and you need markdown (`pip install markdown`).

I hope this will be of use to others too!


## Usage

```python md_collapse_sections.py infile.md outfile.html```

where

* `infile.md` is the input file name (a normal Markdown document)
* `outfile.html` is the file that the output HTML will be written to


## Requirements

* Markdown
